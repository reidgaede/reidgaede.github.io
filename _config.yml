# Contact form:
#Â - static : pass through formspree.io to validate email sending
# - disqus : replace contact form by disqus thread
# - comment the line below if you want to stick with the default PHP contact form
# (6/5/23) Upon being reminded that GitHub Pages does NOT (to my knowledge) work with PHP, "un-commenting-out" 
# the `contact: static` line below this comment to reflect revised intention to use Formspree:
# contact: static

# If you use disqus you need disqus shortname
# https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208
# (6/4/23) Line below this comment "commented-out" in hopes it will help PHP-based "contact_me.php" to
# function correctly:
# disqus_shortname: myshortname
