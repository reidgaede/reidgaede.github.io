# (6/2/23) I wonder if I can just "comment-out" the "client" field without consequence (...?):
# client: Python for Data Science, Web and Core Programming Professional Concentration
category: Data Science
description: For the end-of-course project in my "Python for Data Analysis" course (part of the "Python for Data Science, Web and Core Programming Professional Concentration" offered by the University of California, Davis's Continuing and Professional Education division), I and a group of my fellow classmates used Jupyter, as well as Python's pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries, to perform data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analysis/interpretation that ultimately informed a stock investment recommendation for a hypothetical client. Our submission for this assignment, for which I served as team "project manager", received a perfect score from the course's instructor. <br /> <br /> This project was one of our first major "putting it all together" assignments in which we took everything we had learned over the past six months and applied it to analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting real-world data. It was also our first opportunity to collaborate with fellow students in a way that not only maximized the strength of our final output, but also allowed us to learn from each other and our different approaches to implementing the course content. Overall, this project was a major confidence-builder that showed me  that both alone and in collaboration with others, I could write code, interpret data, and make recommendations that were valuable". <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/GroupProject_StockPriceAnalysisAndVisualization.
