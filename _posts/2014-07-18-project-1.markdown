description: "ToDoToDay", principally built using ReactJS, CSS Modules, and JavaScript, is a variation on the classic "to-do list" interface that integrates the ["Eisenhower Matrix" task management concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) purportedly popularized by the World War II-era general and later United States President of the same name. The project allows users to better manage their daily responsibilities by:
- Uploading, one-by-one, tasks they believe they might need to complete for a given day (new/additional tasks can be uploaded at any time);
- Organizing each task into one of four categories:
  - Important and Urgent;
  - Urgent but Not Important;
  - Not Urgent but Important; and
  - Not Urgent, Not Important; 
- Striking each task as/when completed simply by clicking that task.
