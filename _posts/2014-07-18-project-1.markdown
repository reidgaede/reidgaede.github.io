description: ToDoToDay, principally built using ReactJS, CSS Modules, and JavaScript, is a variation on the classic "to-do list" interface that integrates the "Eisenhower Matrix" task management concept purportedly popularized by the World War II-era general and later United States President of the same name. <br /> <br /> The project allows users to better manage their daily responsibilities by individually entering tasks requiring completion, organizing each task into one of four categories correlated to task importance and urgency, and striking each task as/when completed simply by clicking that task. <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/ToDoToDay.
