description: ToDoToDay, principally built using ReactJS, CSS Modules, and JavaScript, is a variation on the classic "to-do list" interface that integrates the "Eisenhower Matrix" task management concept (purportedly popularized by the World War II-era general and later United States President of the same name). <br /> <br /> The project allows users to better manage their daily responsibilities by individually entering tasks requiring completion, organizing each task into one of four categories correlated to task importance and urgency, and striking each task as/when completed simply by clicking that task. <br /> <br /> ToDoToDay was one of my first experiences wherein I used my software development skills to increase the overall usefulness of a general tool - a to-do list - by integrating a new concept - an Eisenhower Matrix. The project was doubly fulfilling to me in that since completing it, I can say that I use my own interface on a daily basis to hold myself accountable to tasks and ensure foward momentum on long- and short-term obligations. On top of all this, ToDoToDay allowed me to further my skills in component design (React) and responsive web design (CSS media queries). <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/ToDoToDay.
