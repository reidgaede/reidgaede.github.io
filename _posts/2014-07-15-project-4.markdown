# (6/2/23) I wonder if I can just "comment-out" the "client" field without consequence (...?):
# client: Python for Data Science, Web and Core Programming Professional Concentration
category: Data Science
description: For the end-of-course project in my "Data Preparation, Modeling and Visualization with Python" class, I used Jupyter - as well as Python's pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries - to explore, visualize, and ultimately model upon real-world data to predict course passage/failure for students in a Portuguese class. My submission for this assignment received a perfect score from the course's instructor. <br /> <br /> This assignment was essentially the capstone for the final class in the "Python for Data Science, Web and Core Programming Professional Concentration" offered by the University of California, Davis's Continuing and Professional Education division. Over the course of nine months, I had learned Python from the ground-up to build my programming and data science skills, and as it gradually became clearer that I had what it took to develop useful programs, I began to wonder where else I might be able to create value by way of my problem-solving skills. It is in large part my experience with this project to whom I credit my motivation to begin self-teaching web development in the waning months of 2022 via Udemy coursework. <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/End-Of-CourseProject_LogisticRegressionAndDecisionTreeModeling.
