description: ExpensaRasa is a ReactJS-based interface for quick, convenient, and private expense logging and analysis. This project allows users to upload individual expense items, filter their uploaded expenses by the year in which they were incurred, consult the dynamic, on-page chart for a month-by-month, real-time expense breakdown, and "wipe their slate clean" when they are done by refreshing or closing their browser window. <br /> <br /> ExpensaRasa was the first project I completed using React. Having previously worked for the most part with "vanilla JavaScript" to inject functionality into webpages, transitioning to React and the exercise of component building was a challenging, yet enjoyable experience. The project also provided further exposure to implementing CSS media queries to ensure as smooth a user experience as possible across various devices and screen dimensions. <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/ExpensaRasa.
