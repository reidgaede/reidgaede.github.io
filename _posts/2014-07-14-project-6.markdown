description: The projects I have completed thus far have been as fulfilling as they have been educational. I take pride in finding ways to keep my work interesting and challenging, and am excited about the path in front of me and what I will be able to do with what I learn! <br /> <br /> So far, most of my self-education efforts and projects have been focused on front-end development. Naturally, I hope to move into using back-end technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Django, etc., as soon as possible, but for the time being, I am concretely focused on building out my applied ReactJS knowledge, as from what others tell me, having a strong knowledge base in React significantly eases the transition to using other popular front-end JavaScript frameworks - namely AngularJS and Vue.js. <br /> <br /> I eagerly welcome feedback and thoughts, and am always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities - as well as for apprentice/junior-level developer opportunities where I can learn while contributing on a daily basis. Feel free to add/follow me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/reid-gaede/) to stay up-to-speed with my journey!
