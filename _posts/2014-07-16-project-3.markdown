description: MovieFlix CRUD is a CRUD application built with PHP, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, and CSS that allows visitors to create, read, update, and delete records in a collection of films. The front-end of the application connects with a MySQL database to store user input and accordingly adjusts to user-initiated record insertion, modification, and/or deletion requests. <br /> <br /> MovieFlix CRUD was the very first CRUD application I ever built. While the concept behind the project and overall structure were taught via a Udemy course I had recently completed, I took time following the course's conclusion to simultaneously streamline and add new functionalities to the front-end while making simple additions and adjustments on the back-end. It was completing this project and making it my own through personal structure/design decisions that made me decide I wanted to pursue web development further, and not long after, I embarked upon learning ReactJS. <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit https://github.com/reidgaede/MovieFlix_CRUD_App.
